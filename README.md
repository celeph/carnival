# Udacity Carnival Starter Project READ ME

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

The Udacity Carnival consists of 3 Mini-Games: Plinko, Wheel of Fortune, and Coin Toss. With each game, you earn points. When you earn 2000 points, you will receive a virtual classic Carnival prize!

This project was customized as follows:

- Replaced Udacity's default Scoreboard text with my full name.
- Adjusted font size of Scoreboard text so my full name fits into the space.
- Customized Min and Max Toss Power of Carnival Coin Toss component. They match the values given by the hidden easter egg hint.
- Customized Wheel of Fortune and assigned higher point values to smaller wedges.
- Customized Plinko with the Oscillation Distance given in the hidden easter egg hint. Also adjusted speed.
- Moved the Teddy Bear so it does not land on the player but in front of the wheel.
